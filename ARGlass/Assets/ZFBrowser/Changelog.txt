(Version numbers: http://semver.org/)

1.1.0:
Features:
  - You can now adjust or add Chromium switches with
    BrowserNative.commandLineSwitches.
  - Experimental Adobe Flash support (see Readme)
  - CallFunction and EvalJS now return results through a promise; it's
    now much easier to query the page for a specific value.
  - Massively revamped Readme formatting.
  - Cookie API (delete all cookies, CRUD any cookie, date features
    experimental)
  - Added a simpler example of calling/getting called by JS.
  - Added API for setting a custom user agent.
Fixes:
  - Browser should now work correctly with unicode characters in the path.
  - We no longer display an error on page load abort. This allows you to
    see incomplete page loads and also keeps things from breaking if you
    double-click a link.
  - Remove non-ASCII characters from the user agent so things don't break.
  - Dynamically instantiating a BrowserGUI should now work instead of
    dying in the mouse input code.
  - Fix issues with GUIBrowserUI + touchscreen + build.
  - Unity 5.4: Don't spam errors about cursor formats.
  - Unity 5.5: Cope with Profiler namespace change.
	- localGame:// will strip query strings/hashes and try to find the
    underlying file instead of always failing when one is present.

1.0.2:
Fixes:
  - OS X: Asset Store packages still weren't getting the right child process
    permissions, so now the executable permission is always added when
    starting a browser in the Editor.


1.0.1:
Fixes:
  - Rebuild package so ZFGameBrowser has the correct initial permissions
    on OS X.
  - Correctly build browser_assets runtime resource even if there is no
    BrowserAssets directory.
  - NewWindow demo explains how to unzip BrowserAssets like MainDemo.
  - Demo explanation should no longer be replaced by an error on very
    slow computers.
  - Disabling and re-enabling a BrowserGUI GameObject should no longer
    break automatic resizing.
